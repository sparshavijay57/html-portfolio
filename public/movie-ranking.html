<hr />
<h3>Dear Zindagi</h3>
<p>This movie is an unpaid therapy session to me.</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>This movie heals my inner child and makes me feel heard and seen.</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>This movie shows love is beyond money, caste, status, and when you love someone truly, it is unconditional and you would do anything for them to be happy.</p>
